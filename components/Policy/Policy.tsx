          <h5>Entity Level Climate-related Risks Disclosures</h5>
          <p data-bold>
            VSFG Asset Management Limited (“VSAML”) is a corporation licensed by
            the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to carry out
            business in Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on
            securities) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities.
          </p>
          <p data-bold>Governance</p>
          <p>
            VSAML’s governance structure consists of oversight of
            climate-related risks at the level of the board of directors of
            VSAML (the “Board”) and the execution of climate-related risk
            management policies and practices at VSAML’s management level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is responsible for supervising the incorporation of
            climate-related risks into the investment management and risk
            management process of the funds under the management of VSAML (the
            “Funds”). The Board reviews the Fund Investment Policy, which
            provides a basis for managing key risks, including climate-related
            risks at least annually. Besides, the Board receives annual updates
            from the management to monitor the progress of climate-related risk
            management.
          </p>
          <p>
            The management is responsible for the incorporation of
            climate-related risks into the investment management, risk
            management and disclosure process. Each Fund will have each
            individual Investment Committee to review, approve and develop an
            investment plan for targeted investment. The management will monitor
            the status and progress of climate-related risks, and reports to the
            Board annually.
          </p>
          <p data-bold>Investment management</p>
          <p>
            The asset management team identifies relevant and material physical
            and transition climate-related risks by reviewing each Fund’s
            investment strategies and its investment portfolios with reference
            to the Task Force on Client-Related Financial Disclosures
            (‘’TCFD’’). The asset management team assess relevant
            climate-related risks factors into the investment management
            process, and its impact on the performance of underlying investments
            at least annually. The management has determined climate-related
            risks are relevant.
          </p>
          <p data-bold>Risk Management</p>
          <p>
            The asset management team conducts a further assessment by using a
            qualitative method to determine if physical and transition
            climate-related risks are material for the Fund(s) with reference to
            TCFD at least annually, by completing a materiality assessment based
            on proportion of holdings in different industries sectors that are
            subject to high climate-related risks. The management has reviewed
            the assessment and determined that climate-related risks are not
            material.
          </p>
          <p>
            The method of assessing relevance and materiality of climate-related
            risks require subjective judgements and may include consideration of
            third-party data that is incomplete or inaccurate. The assessment
            methodology may change or evolve over time. Relevance and
            materiality have been assessed based on certain qualitative and
            quantitative factors concerning the strategy as well as industry
            practices and subjective estimates, which may change. Any such
            changes may affect the assessment conclusions and previous
            assessments may no longer remain valid. There can be no guarantee
            that the management will correctly identify and assess the impact of
            climate-related risks associated with its asset management activity.
          </p>
          <p data-bold>Disclosure</p>
          <p>
            VSAML discloses the climate-related risks in terms of governance,
            investment management, risk management, relevant process, and
            disclosure policy. The content of disclosure is subject to annual
            review to ensure timeliness of the information disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a relatively new topic in the context of investment management
            and the industry’s practice in managing climate-related risks is
            changing in a rapid pace, VSAML will keep abreast of the latest
            trend in climate-related risk management and continually review our
            process to equip ourselves with the ability and capacity to tackle
            the challenge.
